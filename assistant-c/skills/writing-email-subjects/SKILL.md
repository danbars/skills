# Writing Email Subjects

## Overview
Create a small set of subject line options that match the email’s intent and tone without adding new commitments or changing meaning.
<!--assistant C-->

## When to Use
- You have the body (or a rough draft) but no subject line yet
- The current subject is vague (“Update”, “Quick question”) or too long
- You need variants for different tones (neutral vs. urgent) or audiences (internal vs. external)

**When NOT to use**
- The subject is fixed by a system/process (ticket IDs, legal notices)

## Quick Reference
- Keep it short: ~3–8 words when possible
- Put the differentiator early (topic, date, action)
- Avoid spammy phrasing (ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation)

## Implementation
1. Identify the email’s purpose: inform / request / confirm / schedule.
2. Extract the key noun(s) and the key action or date.
3. Produce 5 options:
   - 2 neutral/professional
   - 2 slightly more direct/urgent (if appropriate)
   - 1 very short “minimal” option

## Common Mistakes
- **Changing meaning**: Don’t imply deadlines or decisions not stated in the email.
- **Too generic**: “Reminder” alone is rarely helpful—add topic/date.
