# Writing Meeting Notes

## Overview
Turn raw notes/transcript into a structured, skimmable record that makes next steps unambiguous.

## When to Use
- Notes are messy, partial, or out of order
- A transcript exists but no one will read it end-to-end
- There were decisions, open questions, or action items to track

**When NOT to use**
- The meeting is purely social with no decisions or follow-ups

## Core Pattern
Separate “what happened” from “what’s next”:
- **Summary** (context)
- **Decisions** (committed outcomes)
- **Action Items** (owner + due date)
- **Open Questions / Risks** (unresolved)

## Quick Reference
Use this template:

- **Attendees**:
- **Context**: (1–3 bullets)
- **Decisions**:
- **Action Items**: (each item has Owner, Due, Next step)
- **Open Questions / Risks**:

## Implementation
1. Scan for explicit decisions (“we will…”, “agreed…”, “we decided…”).
2. Extract actions (“X will do Y by Z”) and assign owners if missing (flag if unknown).
3. Promote unresolved items into Open Questions / Risks.
4. Keep it concise; link to source transcript if needed.

## Common Mistakes
- **Burying action items** in narrative text — always list separately.
- **Inventing owners/dates** — if absent, mark as “Owner: TBD” / “Due: TBD”.
